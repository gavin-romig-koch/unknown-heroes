If you have example code or console text that you want to appear with
all line breaks and relative indentation preserved, in a monospaced text
block, there is no common format for Markdown and reStructuredText.

    A normal paragraph ending with some stuff.

        If the next paragraph is indented by four or more spaces, it will be monospaced text, without flow (or even wrapping in some non-print cases.)

        You can have multiple paragraphs like this, as long as they
        are all indented by the same amount.
        
        


Stat names are inspired by (and in some cases based on) stat names from Apocalypse World.  I tried to come up with stat names that could be used in the sentence “I am <stat-name>”.   



Stats come in pairs, opposites: the more you are of one, the less you are of the other.  Stats are about your interactions with other characters.  One stat in each pair is used for negative interactions, hurting other characters, or defending against hurt.  The other stat in a pair is used for positive interactions, where hurt is not intended, desired, acceptable, or involved.



• Cool (Pursuit, Traps, Ambushes, Escape, Stalk, Tail, Do Something Under Fire, Face a Dangerous Situation), as in cool under fire, rational, clearthinking, calm, calculating, unfazed.  This ability is good for running away, and chasing after others.  It is for hunting after someone, and for avoiding being hunted.  It is for tracking someone or something, and for foiling and fooling your trackers.  It is for standing watch alone in the dark against known or assumed enemies; setting a trap for a dangerous foe; avoiding a trap; it is for getting out of dangerous situation.  It is for getting your ass out of fight.  This is based on your experience with Isolation.  It is for when you are on your own.   It is not about acting in someone else’s interest.  Other people might benefit, but that is not your intention.
• Noble (Status, Charisma, Panache, Leadership) as in of noble character.  This is about how attractive you are.  This is how much people naturally like you.  This is based on how little experience you have with Isolation; as such it is the opposite of Cool.  It is how well you get along in groups or communities.   How well-regarded and trusted are you within your community? This does not necessarily indicate money, though it could. It’s more a matter of whether you act like you belong and have people who vouch for you. Are you on a first-name basis with your pastor? Do cops give you warnings instead of tickets? Do you have more than one person you could call from jail for a bailout? Those are the marks of high Noble.  Noble can not be intentionally used to hurt or disadvantage someone.  Noble can only be used with people you share a community with, so it can’t be used with characters that are alien or monsters to you.



• Hard (Struggle, Attack, Defend with Violence), as in hard-hearted, violent, aggressive, strong-willed, mean, physically, mentally, and emotionally powerfully violent.  It can also be used to defend oneself or others against attack when you to hurt the attacker as part of your defence.  It is based on your experience with Violence.  Hard is your willingness, even desire, to hurt someone.   It does not measure training in martial arts; it measures pure willingness and experience in raw hurt.  Hard is not cool; hard is not measured; hard is barely controlled at best; hard is scary.
• Friendly (Connect) when you want to make a connection with someone.  Friendly is the opposite of Hard.  When you want to have an honest conversation with someone.  When you don’t want to come across as a dangerous creep.  It’s about making a friend or ally when you have nothing to offer except your friendship.  



• Hot (Lie, Seduce, Manipulate, Con) as in damn hot, attractive, subtle, gracious, sexy, beautiful, inspiring, exciting.  You are best at lying about the things you yourself believe.  Hotness is the ability to believe multiple contrary things.  The Hottest people are the ones that know they are hot, and know it so well they convince others of their hotness.  It is also the ability to know when you are being lied to, manipulated, conned, and to defend yourself against such, by lying or manipulating the other guy better.  If you are Hot, you can tell when someone is lying to you, but you can’t figure out exactly what or why.  Hot is based on how much experience you have with Guilt.
• Wise (Knowledge, Education, Self Knowledge, Experience) More about how comfortable you are with your worldview; and with other people’s world view. High Self knowledge.  Wise is the opposite of Hot.  Wise is your ability to tell when something is a lie, in what way it is a lie, and why someone is lying to you, but it doesn’t give you any ability to lie yourself.  You can’t use Wise to intentionally lie, con, seduce, or manipulate someone. 



• Sharp (Dodge, Duck, Slick, Confuse, Needle, Annoy, Pushing Other’s Buttons, Read a Situation or Person), as in sharp-witted, cunning like a fox, alert to others faults and flaws, smart-assed.  This is based on your experience with Helplessness, both being/feeling helpless and handing it out to others.  This is your ability to avoid being hurt when you are helpless.  It is not about your ability to dodge while attacking someone.  It is all out defense.  It is totally selfish, it can’t be used to defend someone else.  Sharp can not be used to actively or significantly hurt someone because it comes from a belief that you are helpless, but it can passively be used to inflict just a little hurt, confusion, guilt, fear, to reduce or avoid the hurt being done to you. 
• Fit (Athletic, Dexterity, Strength) Fit is used for physical, mental, or emotional feats where you are unwilling to hurt someone else, or where there is no one to hurt.  Hurling a shot put in a sporting event is Fit; hurling a big rock to hurt someone is Hard.   Intervening when one friend attacks another friend would be Fit; intervening when a monster attacks your friend would be Hard.  Fit is the opposite of Sharp.  Fit is based on your lack of experience with Helplessness.



• Weird (Secrecy, Hide, Detect Hidden) as in weirdo, psychic, genius, uncanny, lucky, strange,
prophetic, touched.  Weird is based on your experience with the Unnatural.  Weird is about how well you deal with situations and things that are strange to you.  It is how well you can hide things, and hide yourself.  It is also about spotting hidden things.  Weird is also your ability to learn things that seem unnatural to you.
• Perceptive (Notice, Observe, Spot Hidden) This is your ability to notice things, or spot hidden items.  It is the opposite of Weird.  It is based on your lack of experience with the Unnatural.  It can not be used to hide or obscure yourself or other things.  Perceptive is your ability to learn things that don’t seem unnatural to you.

Swords & Wizardry

    Calls itself “0e”,  Old School

    Std D&D stats 

Armor and protection

Unarmored characters have a “base AAC (Ascending Armor Class)” of 10. Wearing armor improves (adds) to that score, as does a high dexterity. This means it’s harder to hit you to cause damage if you wear better armor. If you have a low dexterity, the penalty makes your armor less effective (lowering your AAC).

Attack roll 
If you are going to attack a monster with a sword or bow, you need to make an attack roll. You roll the twenty-sided dice (d20) and tell the Game Referee what the dice shows. If you have a high enough Strength (for melee, hand to hand combat) or Dexterity (for bows, slings and crossbows), you might get a bonus to your attack roll. There may be other bonuses or penalties that apply to your roll. When characters attack monsters, use the following chart to see if the character hits. Look at the monster’s AAC (Armor Class) column and the level of the character (which for the Quick Start is always Level 1); the number shown at the intersection is the number they must get (or higher) on a d20 to successfully hit a monster. This is true for both missile attacks and melee attacks. Player To Hit Chart Monster Armor Class 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Level Attack Roll (d20) Required to hit 1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 When monsters attack characters, use these charts to see if they hit. Look at the character’s AAC (Armor Class) column and the level of the monster (their Hit
7Dice) row; the number shown at the intersection is the number the monster must roll (or higher) on a d20 to successfully hit the character. This is true for both missile attacks and melee attacks. For monsters that have a Hit Dice such as 1+1, use the next level up – so a 1+1 HD monster attacks as a monster with 2 HD.

Damage roll 

If you hit, you get to roll damage! Most weapons use the d6, some use the d4, and a rare few use the d8 or d10! If you have a high enough Strength and you hit using a melee weapon, you can add your bonus (or apply your penalty) to the damage.

Damage and death

When a character (or creature) is hit, the amount of damage is deducted from his hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character is unconscious. The character actually dies if he reaches -1 (for first level characters)

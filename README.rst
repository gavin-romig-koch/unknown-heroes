If you have example code or console text that you want to appear with
all line breaks and relative indentation preserved, in a monospaced text
block, there is no common format for Markdown and reStructuredText.

    A normal paragraph ending with some stuff.

        If the next paragraph is indented by four or more spaces, it will be monospaced text, without flow (or even wrapping in some non-print cases.)

        You can have multiple paragraphs like this, as long as they
        are all indented by the same amount.
